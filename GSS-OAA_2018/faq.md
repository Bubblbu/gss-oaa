# Open Access Award (OAA) 2018 - FAQ’s
> Awarding Open Scholarship at SFU

## How much is the Award?
The amount is $100 per award. 

## Who is eligible?
Current SFU graduate students and recent graduates (within 1 year of convocation) who have a paper published (or accepted with no further revisions) in an Open Access journal may apply. If you are one of multiple authors, you must clearly articulate your role in producing the paper (e.g., wrote paper, wrote section, collected data, etc.). The article must be published or accepted without further revisions. The name of the author(s) should be printed on the title page of the article.

## What if the author has more than one open access article published or accepted?
Authors may submit separate applications for each article. A maximum of one award for each author will be granted, but multiple publications will increase the chance of winning an award.

## How is the award distributed for papers with more than one GSS member as author?
As the OAA rewards authors for open scholarship each author may win. Two or more eligible authors who each apply may each receive an individual award for the same article.

## Which journals are eligible?
Eligible journals will be those in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) or those that qualify but haven’t been entered yet. In these cases SFU Library will assess the eligibility of journals.

## What type of article is eligible?
Published articles or articles that have been accepted for publication are eligible for consideration. "Accepted for publication" means that the peer-review process has been successfully completed and that no further revisions are required. Proof of acceptance must be provided as an attachment to the application.

## Does my article need to be in the ​SFU Summit Research Repository?
Yes, all articles submitted for this award will need to have been submitted to the SFU Summit Research Repository prior to the application deadline to be eligible for an award. The application form for submitting to the Repository can be found [here](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/publish/summit-deposit-form). 

## Who will adjudicate this award?
The award is jointly administered by the GSS and SFU Library. Award recipients will be selected by lottery.

## Will the Award winners' names be made public?
Yes, a list of authors, article links, and brief author bios will be published on the GSS website each year the award is granted.

## Will the Award be made available permanently?
This is currently a pilot project which will be evaluated on an annual basis. Continuation of this initiative depends on the outcome of the pilot and the availability of sustainable funding.
