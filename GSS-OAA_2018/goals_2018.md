# Open Access Award 2018

The Graduate Student Society has successfully conducted the Open Access Award (OAA) in the last three years. While the number of awarded students and their award sizes varied, there has always been positive feedback from the students. With the recent developments of [negotiations between Elsevier and Germany & Sweden]() the importance and direct impact of Open Access on the academy is becoming increasingly visible. in 2018 we want to continue to optimise and improve our efforts at recognising and rewarding examples of Open Scholarship and committment to a better science at SFU. Thus, in order to work towards a more sustainable and successful OAA we want to reflect on the last three years and overhaul structural and operational elements of the award.

## Reflecting on three years of OAA

- **Financial** 
    - The number and size of awards has been fluctuating over the last few years as (1) funding wasn't stable and (2) we also tried to optimise the size of the award. This year we are settling on 100$ per award, which is the middle ground between 2017 (125) and 2016 (75) while we are also hoping to increase the volume of awards (20-30).
    - As the award is dependent on the funding and support of institutions within SFU a better recognition of that contribution could help to incentivise continued and new support from SFU related entities 
- **Operations within GSS**
    - Even thought the OAA is relatively low-effort, management and organisations among and within GSS members has been a challenge. Thus, there is an interest in (1) streamlining and optimising the workflow of the award and (2) and reorganising the internal responsibilities.
- **Transparency**
    - The reports are an important tool for future OAAs as well as funders. In an effort to increase transparency we would like to (1) automatizee parts of the reporting and (2) publicly publish the annual reports.
