## About this repository

This repository aims to simplify the annual administration of the award for old and new maintainers of the project.

**Work in progress**

## Recommendations for next year

- provide more concrete examples and formatting for DOI and ISSN fields
- ask for a link to the editorial page if not in DOAJ
- add some language around the colours of OA (gold vs hybrid) and explain why gold/hybrid doesn't qualify
